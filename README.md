# How to create a portable Python yourself
1) Download Portable Python
2) Extract Portable Python in a folder, lets call it $PPython1
3) Execute $PPython1\App\python-3.2.5.msi
4) Deactivate all optional packages during installation. Install the application to a folder, let's call it $PPython2
5) The create folder $PPython2 is now portable (i.e. it can be moved around and python.exe can still be executed)
